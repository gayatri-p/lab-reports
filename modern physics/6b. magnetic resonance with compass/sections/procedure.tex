\section{Procedure}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Arrange the permanent magnet such that magnetic fields of the coil and the permanent magnet are perpendicular to each other.
    \item Apply a sine wave with a frequency in the range of 1 to 3 Hz using the function generator, ensuring that the 20 dB button is pressed on the level button of the generator.
    \item Slowly adjust the frequency to determine the resonance frequency for a fixed distance between the magnet and the coil.
    \item Obtain the magnetic field versus distance data provided to you.
\end{enumerate}
