    This experiment derived the resonance condition for a magnetic compass in an oscillating magnetic field. By systematically adjusting the distance between a magnet and the compass, we observed resonance. To provide a qualitative understanding, we also illustrated the relationship between resonance frequency and magnetic field. This experiment showcases a classical demonstration of magnetic resonance.
