    Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) was observed in this experiment by subjecting a sample to an alternating magnetic field while applying an RF signal. The resonance conditions were analyzed using an oscilloscope to calculate the g-factor. This measurement offers valuable information about the electronic and magnetic properties of the sample.
