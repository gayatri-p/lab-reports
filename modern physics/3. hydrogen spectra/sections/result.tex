\section{Discussion and Conclusion}
The wavelengths of the three Balmer lines identified in this experiment were 537.54 nm (H$_\alpha$), 541.57 nm (H$_\beta$) and 553.09 nm (H$_\gamma$), while the literature values of these lines are 670 nm, 790 nm and 440 nm respectively. Hence our values are quite off.

The calculated value of Rydberg's constant from these Hydrogen lines is $R_y=(0.744 \pm 0.042) \times 10^{7}\,m^{-1}$ while the literature value is $R_y= 1.097 \times 10^{7}\,m^{-1}$. The large error in the final values could be due to he distinct lines in the spectrum being very close to each other. This was also heavy backlash error associated with the spectrometer. This resulted in some odd values in the data.
