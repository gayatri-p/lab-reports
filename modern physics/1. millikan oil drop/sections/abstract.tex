    The experiment aimed to measure the elementary charge ($e$) using the Millikan oil drop method. By balancing gravitational, buoyant, and electric forces on small oil droplets suspended between charged plates, we were able to determine the charge on individual droplets. Repeated measurements of multiple droplets allowed for the identification of the smallest common charge, corresponding to the elementary charge.
