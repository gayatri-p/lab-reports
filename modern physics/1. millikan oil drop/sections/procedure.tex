\section{Procedure}

\subsection{Dynamic Method}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Set the timer and voltage to zero.
    \item Spray oil droplets from the atomizer. The drifting down
    of oil droplets can be viewed from the monitor.
    \item Note down the time the oil droplet takes to reach the second
    line from the bottom line starting from the second line
    from the top (the preset lines). 
    \item Switch on the voltage to
    make the oil droplet rise through air (if it is positively
    charged) and measure the time it takes to rise between
    the preset lines at a constant voltage. Note down the
    voltage and rise time.
    \item Repeat the above two steps for
    6-9 times. The data obtained in this manner is then used
    to calculate the value of $e$ by the procedure described in
    the previous section.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Balancing Method}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Spray oil droplets from the
    atomizer.
    \item By varying the voltage, try to balance any of
    the oil droplets. Note down the balancing voltage.
    \item By repeating step (3) of the dynamic method, fall time of the oil droplets can be found out, which will be used to
    calculate the radius of the oil droplet.
\end{enumerate}
