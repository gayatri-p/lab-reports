    Our experiment employed a neon-filled Franck-Hertz tube to examine the quantized energy states of neon atoms. We gradually increased the accelerating voltage applied to the tube and observed corresponding fluctuations in the current. Peaks in the current occurred at specific voltages, indicating the points where electrons lost energy through inelastic collisions with neon atoms. The spacing between these peaks allowed us to determine the excitation energy of neon, providing empirical evidence for the quantized nature of atomic energy levels.
