\section{Procedure}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Set the Franck Hertz operating unit to manual mode, with all control knobs turned to their extreme anticlockwise positions.
    \item Adjust voltage settings $U_{KG}$ and $U_{AE}$ to approximately 4-6 V and 4-8 V, respectively such that there can be three peaks of current in the whole measurement.
    \item Slowly vary acceleration voltage $U_A$ from 0 to 80 V, and record the corresponding collector current.
    \item Repeat the experiment for 3 different sets of filament and grid voltages.
\end{enumerate}
