\section{Objective}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Quantitatively study transverse normal Zeeman Effect by observing the splitting of the rings due to magnetic field resolved by Fabry-Perot etalon using a CMOS     camera and evaluate the value of Bohr's magneton ($\mu$B). Observe the polarization of the rings using a polarizer 
    \item Observe the left circular and right circular polarized lines in anomalous normal Zeeman effect by using quarter wave plate and polarizer. 
    \item Observe the transverse anomalous Zeeman effect and polarization of the rings using a polarizer
    \item Observe the longitudinal anomalous Zeeman effect and left circular and right
    circular polarized lines in anomalous normal Zeeman effect by using quarter
    wave plate and polarizer.
