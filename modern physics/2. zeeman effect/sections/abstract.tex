    In this experiment, we use Cadmium lamp subjected to various magnetic
field intensities to study normal and anomalous Zeeman effect, with the help of a Fabry-Perot etalon. 
% The amount of splitting is measured by the physical distance between the spectral lines. 
We then study the various components of Zeeman lines and their respective polarizations by varying the direction of the applied magnetic field.
We also try to measure the value of Bohr's magneton from the results.
