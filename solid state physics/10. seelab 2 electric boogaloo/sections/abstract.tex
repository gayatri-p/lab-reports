    In this experiment, we use a simple and cheap experimental set-up to determine the band gap of germanium using the SeeLab kit and a diode. We observe  the temperature dependence of the reverse current through diodes at different temperatures, and use the diode equation to estimate the band-gap. Our results agreed with the literature value to a certain extent. We also discuss various shortcomings of this particular method in the estimation of band-gap.
