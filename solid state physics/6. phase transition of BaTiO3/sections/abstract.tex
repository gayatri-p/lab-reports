	We also noticed the frequency dependence of capacitance for BaTiO$_3$ and multilayer and disc ceramic capacitors operating at room temperature.
	We determine the balancing capacitance to arrive at the balancing resistance of the sample at increasing temperatures using a Schering bridge setup to find our the Curie temperature of the sample, which came out to be around $135^\circ$. 
	Additionally, we also computed the diffuseness parameter for the samples which ranges from 1 to 2 for all frequencies.
