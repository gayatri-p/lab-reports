    In this experiment, we use UV-Vis spectroscopy to determine the bandgap energies of different materials. Specifically, we use the Tuac method to plot the absorption coefficient as a function of energy for three direct band gap materials -- CdS, ZnTe and ZnO -- to estimate their band gap values.
