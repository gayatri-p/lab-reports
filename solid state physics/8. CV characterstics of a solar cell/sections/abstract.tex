    The capacitance-voltage (C-V) characteristics of a solar cell provide essential insights into its doping
    profile and junction properties.
    This experiment measures the C-V profile by applying a variable DC
    voltage and a small AC signal to the solar cell and observing the resulting capacitance. A summing amplifier combines the signals, while a transimpedance amplifier converts the AC current into a measurable voltage. 
    We then try to estimate the doping density and the built in voltage of the solar cell.
    % The setup allows for precise extraction of the solar cellâ€™s capacitance, revealing critical information about its electrical behavior.
