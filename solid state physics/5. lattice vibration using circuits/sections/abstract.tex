    In this experiment, we explore the concept of lattice vibrations using an electrical circuit analogy.
We construct circuits simulating both monoatomic and diatomic lattice structures using inductors and capacitors. For both the setups, we analyzed their dispersion relation, by measuring how the phase changes depending on the oscillation frequency.
We also observed the emergence of a bandgap in the diatomic lattice case. Measurements were carried out using a function generator and an oscilloscope in XY mode, with precise phase difference recordings. The results were compared with theoretical predictions to validate
the models. This experiment demonstrates the effectiveness of electronic circuits in visualizing and understanding
the fundamental principles of lattice dynamics.
