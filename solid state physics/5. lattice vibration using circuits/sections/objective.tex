\section{Objective}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item To study the dispersion relation for the mono-atomic lattice and determine the cutoff frequency.
    \item To study the dispersion relation for the di-atomic lattice and analyse the optical
    and acoustic modes and obtain the energy gap.
\end{enumerate}
