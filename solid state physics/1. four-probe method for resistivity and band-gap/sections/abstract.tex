    In this experiment, we employed the Four-Probe method, which uses four collinear probes for electrical contact, tomeasure the resistivity of Silicon, Germanium, and Aluminium samples at room temperature. Additionally, we studied the temperature variation of resistivity for Aluminium and Germanium and estimated the band gap energy of Germanium.
