    This experiment investigates the I-V characteristics of a solar cell under different illumination
conditions -- room light and sunlight, using various optical filters. We try to analyze the
impact of different light intensities and wavelengths on the performance of the solar cell.
% The fundamental theory of photovoltaic energy conversion discusses the generation of photocurrent.
The experiment was performed by measuring current and voltage characteristics using a potentiometer and
multimeter while varying external parameters such as light source and filters. Key performance
metrics such as short-circuit current ($I_\text{sc}$), open-circuit voltage ($V_\text{oc}$), fill factor (FF) are determined
for each scenario.
