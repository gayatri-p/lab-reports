    In this experiment, we investigate the Magnetoresistance and Hall effect of a sample of Bismuth. We first measure the variation of magnetoresistance with the external magnetic field and find a non-linear relation between the two. The fractional change in the magnetoresistance was found to increase exponentially with the log of the magnetic field. 
    Furthermore, we also find the Hall coefficient of the sample at room temperature along with the carrier concentration and mobility. 
    We then compare these results for the ones obtained for semiconductors.
    These results have important implications for the understanding and
    characterization of such conductors and their electronic properties.
