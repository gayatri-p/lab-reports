\section{Discussion \& Conclusion}
In this experiment, we have studied various logic gates and have verified boolean logic operations using ICs. We have also demonstrated De Morgan's Law using NAND and NOR gates and verified the output. We can here observe the importance of De Morgan's Law as it can be used to implement any logic gate as combinations of only NAND gates or NOR gates. Hence we can manufacture ICs easily in a cost-efficient way. 

Hence we are now familiar with the working and functioning of Digital logic gates and Integrated Chips.

\section{Precautions}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Verify the connections before switching on the circuit.
    \item Make sure take readings only when all the the connections are closed.
    \item Make sure the IC is properly grounded.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Applications}
Logic gates are extensively used in the modern world. They can be used in digital measuring instruments, calculators, automation control machines, digital memory devices for storage etc. A combination of a few to thousands of logic gates are used in manufacturing ICs used in microprocessors, CPUs and GPUs, which make up our computers, mobile phones and laptops.
