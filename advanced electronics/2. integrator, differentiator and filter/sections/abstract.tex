\begin{abstract}
    In this experiment we try to construct differentiator and integrator circuits using op-amps and study their properties. We also discuss their faults and ways to rectify them.
    Furthermore, we also build and study active high-pass and low-pass filters using op-amps and their frequency response curves.
