\section{Discussion \& Conclusion}

In this experiment, we explored binary addition and subtraction and their practical implementation using logic gates. We discussed the construction of N-bit adders/subtractors using ripple carry circuits. We also discussed the need for carry and borrow bits, their integration in full adder/subtractor circuits, and finally designing a combined adder-subtractor controlled by a signal.

\section{Precautions}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Make sure the connections are proper before switching on the circuit.
    \item Make sure to connect a resistor parallel to the LED as to not burn out the LED.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Applications}
Adders \& Subtractors are wildly used in a computer's ALU (Arithmetic and Logic Unit) to perform operations as well as in CPUs and GPUs.
They are also used in microcontrollers for arithmetic additions, program counters, timers and in networking and digital signal processing systems.
