    Operational Amplifiers, or Op-amps as they are more commonly called, are one of the basic building blocks of Analogue Electronic Circuits. In this, we demonstrate basic op-amp configurations and build summing and difference amplifiers. We also show the application op-amp as a comparator as well as a Schmitt trigger, which shows hysteresis. Additionally, we broadly discuss the design of a power supply system which can provide power to an op-amp as well as different types of grounding systems.
