\section{observations}
In the experiment, the number of turns of the coil was $n=600$, average field line length for the sample $L=232$ mm, and $n/L= 2586.2$ m$^{-1}$. From the, we are able to calculate applied magnetic field intensity as,

\begin{align}
    H=(n/L)I
\end{align}

A observational values for the hysteresis curve and degaussing are given in tables I and II.

\section{Data Analysis and Calculations}

\subsection*{Hysteresis Curve}

From table I, we can plot the hysteresis curve for the iron core.

    \caption{Induced Magnetic field intensity ($B$) vs Applied Magnetic field intensity ($H$) curve}
    \label{graph:1}
\end{figure}

From Fig. \ref{graph:1}, we can find the the following parameters:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Saturation magnetization, by finding the saturation value of B, which is $B_S \approx 3650$ Gauss.
    \item Remanence or Retentivity, by finding $B|_{H=0} = B_r = 570$ Gauss.
    \item Coercivity, by finding $H|_{B=0} = H_C = 516$ A/m (in magnitude).
\end{itemize} 

\subsection*{Degaussing the Iron Core}
From table II, B vs $|$B$_r|$ plot was generated as follows.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\columnwidth]{images/g2.png}
    \caption{Induced Magnetic field intensity ($B$) vs Magnitude of Remnant magnetic field at $I=0$ ($|B_r|$)}
    \label{graph:2}
\end{figure}

Here, we can see that the remnant magnetic field decreases and eventually reaches 0 as we continue degaussing the iron core.
