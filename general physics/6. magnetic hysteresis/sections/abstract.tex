    The aim of the experiment was to study the variation of induced magnetic field concerning the ex
ternal magnetization intensity (H) in ferromagnetic materials, known as magnetic hysteresis.
We determined important parameters, including retentivity, saturation point, and
coercivity. Additionally, we discussed
the phenomenon of degaussing in ferromagnetic materials.
