    This experiment presents a method for estimating the specific charge of an electron, which is the ratio of its charge and its mass, using the fine beam tube method. Using the property of a Helmholtz coil to produce a uniform magnetic field, we study the path of an electron beam accelerated through a known potential under varied external magnetic fields to measure this value.
