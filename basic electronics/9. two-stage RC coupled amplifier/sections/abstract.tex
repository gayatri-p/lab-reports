    A multi-stage amplifier circuit extensively used in electronic circuits. Here the individual stages of the amplifier are connected together using a resistor-capacitor combination.The successive stages amplify the signal and the overall gain is raised to the desired level. Much higher gain can be obtained by connecting a number of amplifier stages in succession.

    RC coupling in amplifiers are most widely used to connect the output of first stage to the input of the second stage and so on. This type of coupling is most popular because it is cheap and provides a constant amplification over a wide range of frequencies.  The main purpose of this circuit is pre-amplification that is to make weak signals to be stronger enough for further amplification. In this experiment, we design two-stage RC coupled common emitter transistor amplifier circuit and study its characterstics, including how it responds to different frequencies.
