\begin{abstract}
    In this experiment, we study the behaviour of bipolar junction transistors in two circuit configurations, namely the common emmiter and the common base modes. Studying the input, output and transfer characteristics of such circuits, contributes to our understanding of transistor and transistor configurations, as well as their application in modern electronics.
