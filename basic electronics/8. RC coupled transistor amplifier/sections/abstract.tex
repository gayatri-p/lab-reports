    A single-stage common emitter RC coupled amplifier is a simple and elementary amplifier circuit.  The main purpose of this circuit is pre-amplification that is to make weak signals to be stronger enough for further amplification. In this experiment, we design RC coupled common emitter transistor amplifier circuit and study its characterstics, including how it responds to different frequencies.
