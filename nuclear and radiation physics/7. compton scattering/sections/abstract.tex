    Compton scattering describes the inelastic interaction of high-energy photons with electrons, leading to
a wavelength shift dependent on the scattering angle. In this experiment we try to study the energy calibration of scintillator and its calibration factor using compton scattering. We also study the wavelength shift using both copper and aluminum as scatter bodies. In both situations, we found that the relative energy and intensity of scattered photons dropped with increasing scattering angle.
