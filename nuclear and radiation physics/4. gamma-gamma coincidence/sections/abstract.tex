    In this experiment, we observed and recorded the coincidences of gamma rays produced during $^{22}$Na nuclear decay. $\gamma-\gamma$ coincidence is the concurrent emission of gamma ray pairs produced in the positron-electron annihilation process. We have used scintillation detectors which use sodium iodide and specialised electronic modules. The coincidence rates are measured for four different configurations of the angular separation between the two detectors. Hence, we are able to find that the the coincidences are maximum when the detectors are placed 180$^\circ$ to each other.
