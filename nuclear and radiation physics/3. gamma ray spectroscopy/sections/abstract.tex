    In this experiment, we investigate the gamma ray spectroscopy of sever radioactive materials, using a scintillation detector in both SCA and MCA modes. Using the known spectrum of Cs-137, we determine the operating voltage of the detector and find its resolution, which turns out to be 9.14\%. In the multiple channel mode, using the known peak energy sources, we calibrate the spectrum to find the peak energies of a Na-22 source. We also compute the mass absorption coefficient of Aluminum by studing the penetration of gamma rays as we vary its thickness.
