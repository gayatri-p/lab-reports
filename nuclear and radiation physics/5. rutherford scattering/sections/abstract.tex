    In this experiment, we investigate Rutherfordâ€™s $\alpha$-particle scattering experiment using a gold foil. The primary objective is to validate the dependence of the scattering cross-section on $\sin^{-4}(\theta/2)$, using an Am-241 $\alpha$ decay source in our experimental setup. Additionally, we also estimate the nuclear charge of Aluminium by performing the scattering experiment with similar parameters for both gold and aluminium and then comparing the two.
