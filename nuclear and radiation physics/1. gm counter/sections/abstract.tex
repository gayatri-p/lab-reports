In this experiment, we use the Geiger-Muller (GM) counter to study the quantification of radioactivity. We first determine the the characteristics of a GM Counter and find its operating frequency for both a $\beta$ and a $\gamma$ source. We then verify the inverse square law relation of count rates with distance. We also calculate the activity of Cs-137 and hence efficiency of the GM counter. Furthermore, we also analyse counting statistics and verify that for a large number of measurements, our count distribution resembles a normal distribution.
