    In this experiment, we investigate the performance of a Geiger-Muller counter using Tl-204 and Sr-90 beta sources. The half-thickness method is used to determine beta particle range and endpoint energy. We also explore  Bremsstrahlung production and attenuation, beta backscattering, focusing on the effects of absorber material and thickness. These findings enhance understanding of beta radiation interactions and aid in optimizing radiation detection and shielding.
